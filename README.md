Perform a full EDA workflow on the Titanic dataset.

🛳 Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns and identify key factors that influenced passenger outcomes.

📊 Project Overview

This repository contains:

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic passenger data

✅ Visualizations (age distribution, class-survival breakdown, correlation heatmap)

✅ Insights on feature importance and relationships

🔍 Key Insights

* Passenger Class (Pclass) and Fare are highly correlated and jointly impact survival odds.

* Age distribution peaks around 30, but younger children and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.

* Family size features (SibSp, Parch) moderately correlate and may be combined for better modeling.

* Most variables contribute individually; no extreme multicollinearity detected, but caution is needed in feature selection.
  
📈 Dependencies

Python 3.x
